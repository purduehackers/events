# ðŸ—“ Purdue Hackers Events

A website where you can check out all Purdue Hackers events & RSVP for upcoming events.

ðŸ›  Built with Next.js, Tailwind, & TypeScript.

## How it works
Organizers add event details to an Airtable base. All upcoming events are displayed on the homepage.

Every time a new event is added to Airtable, a page is automatically generated for that event with all the data filled in, in addition to an email form that you can fill out to RSVP for the event. At 12pm the day before each event, an email is automatically sent to everyone who RSVPed reminding them of the event.
