# ðŸ—“ Purdue Hackers Events

A website where you can check out all Purdue Hackers events & RSVP for upcoming events.

ðŸ›  Built with Next.js, Tailwind, & TypeScript.

## How it works
Organizers add event details to Sanity. All upcoming events are displayed on the homepage.

Every time a new event is added to Sanity, a page is automatically generated for that event with all the data filled in, in addition to an email form that you can fill out to RSVP for the event. At 12pm the day before each event, an email is automatically sent to everyone who RSVPed reminding them of the event.

## Run locally
`git clone https://github.com/purduehackers/events.git`

Create a `.env` file and add the following values:

```
SANITY_TOKEN=
SANITY_PROJECT_ID=
RESEND_API_KEY=
```

Ping `@matthew!!!` in the Purdue Hackers Discord if you need these values. If you're on the Vercel team, you can get them from the "Environment Variables" settings on the dashboard.
