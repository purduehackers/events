👻 We had a spooky Hack Night this week! People were invited to dress up for tonight and they did not disappoint!

👻 Folks had a lot of fun the Systems Circle, with the highest attendance it has had to date!

👻 At 🏁 Checkpoints we got to debut the ☎️✨ Phone Bell ✨☎️ a new method of alerting people to open the door for people who want to get in to Hack Night!

👻 People also showed off software that lets you yell at a computer to make it faster, mathematical visualizations for a point-circle, and more!

We also revealed information about our culminating show at the end of the semester... BURST ✷
