We ran our last Hack Night last week...but now, the underground hackers have taken over, and are running Hack Night 5.25.1 ❌

Here's what's happening:

- `e~a~a|a` **(10:00pm)**: Session: The state of wasm research, by @fish (he's back!)
- `0~0~0` **(12:00am)**: 🏁Checkpoints
- `1~5~5|5` **(2:00am)**: DJ set: FizzyApple12 b2b hewillyeah

If any underground hackers want to run their own sessions etc, ping me and I'll add it to the schedule. Happy dead week, see u tomorrow 🖤
