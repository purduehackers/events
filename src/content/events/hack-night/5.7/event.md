üçê We ran another passport ceremony, with 7 high-quality passports!

üçê The bakers made buckeyes, and printed receipts entitling folks to at least one buckeye.

üçê A small group of folks pulled out a webcam and recorded interviews with Hack Night attendees, about what they do at & think about Hack Night, how long they've been in Purdue Hackers, etc.

üçê The Sign finally shipped after a year and a half of work!!!!

üçê People shared awesome stuff at üèÅCheckpoints, including a Nintendo DS Emulator (1 year in the making!) the Sign, and a platformer game where you bounce on top of music visualizations, which began at the Hack Night 5.0 brainstorming session!

üçê Bruce Schechter, a Purdue alum and startup investor, chatted with students for 2 hours.

We covered lots of ground at Hack Night 5.7!!!
