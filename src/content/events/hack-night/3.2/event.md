ðŸ§© A really special event. 85 people! The badge this week was special: the entire thing was a puzzle where every piece was unique & labeled in hexadecimal, 0x00-0x45 (70 total pieces). We assembled the puzzle at the beginning of Hack Night, then everyone took a piece off of it for themselves. âœ¨

The sign circle got past a roadblock, a test run of our upcoming [Fireworks Workshop](https://events.purduehackers.com/fireworks-workshop) went amazingly, we had midnight popcorn, ramen, and mac & cheese, and people hung out for a _long_ timeâ€”around 7:15!
