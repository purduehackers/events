New sugary drinks unlocked!!! 70 people joined us for the first Hack Night of the Spring 2024 semester, featuring a new midnight Hacker Bar, a Minecraft modding session, and some out-of-state guests âœ¨

The end time is not a typo: this week, a group of 4-6 people decided to run a 24-hour hack nightâ€”and they succeeded. Hack Night 3.12 ended at 8:45pm on Saturday. ðŸ¤¯
