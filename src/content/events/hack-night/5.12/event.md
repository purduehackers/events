ü™º Hack Night 5.12 had excellent vibes. The door opener returned, an industrial robot arm cleaning operation began, and a Hack Night miracle occurred (a group of regulars who thought they had a conflict were able to come).

ü™º The chefs made homemade ice cream: vanilla, coffee, and cookie dough.

ü™º Tonight's üèÅCheckpoints included Image Playground on an iPhone 12, a server, and the website for [BURST ‚ú∑](https://burst.purduehackers.com).

An excellent event just before everyone left for Thanksgiving break!
