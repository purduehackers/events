September 16th, 2022, we ran our first ever Hack Night. 30 people of all skill levels came together to hack on their own projects. We had pizza & snacks, and the vibes were wonderful ðŸ˜Œ

Near the end, we started playing Jackbox games. The event ended when the last person left at 10:40pm, putting this event at just over 3 and a half hours long.
