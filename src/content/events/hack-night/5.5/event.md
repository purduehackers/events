🃏 Many attended Hack Night 5.5 despite it being the Friday before Fall Break. Featuring the Spoken Language & Systems Circles, as well as a Talk on "The Birth, Death, and Resurgence of RSS"!

A group has begun cooking & baking things at Hack Night, and some other folks have purchased receipt printers for maximum receipt printing goodness. This week they baked cookies 🍪 & cooked steak 🥩 Excellent vibes all around.
