This week, Hack Night took place in an underwater city 🐠🤿 25 people, many first-timers, hacked together. Someone made a weather API to learn Go; another worked on groundbreaking research 🔎 we had board games and Smash for when people needed a break.

We broke two records at Hack Night 2.3: longest time with more than 10 people (~2:00am) and longest Hack Night (5:40am)!
