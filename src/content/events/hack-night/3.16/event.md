Hack Night 3.16 launched the last new thing before 4.0: Midnight Demos. At `0~0~0`, folks gathered in a circle and shared things they had madeâ€”including a packet sniffer, VR experiments, CAD models, and art.

4 people made passports in another beta passport ceremony, the programming languages reading circle went strong, and the vibes were excellent. Lots of anticipation for Hack Night 4.0 next week!
