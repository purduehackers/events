Different vibes this week! We were at about half our regular attendance until later in the night because of a Crazy Monkeys show (it turns out the overlap between Hack Night regulars and Crazy Monkeys fans is high ðŸ¤¯), so this Hack Night was somewhat backloaded. Still, 80+ people showed up & made cool stuff. Our favorite this week: a glass shattering effect for jailbroken iPhones.

This week also marked the first beta passport-making ceremonyâ€”10 people made their own NFC-enabled passports! You'll hear a lot more about this project in the coming weeks as we begin to scale up.

Finally, we made 10 laminated cards for people to share what they're working on & encourage other people to talk to them. This was an experiment, but we're excited to make this a bigger part of Hack Night in future weeks.

Great vibes overall.
