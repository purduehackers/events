ðŸªž We stared into each other's souls for Hack Night 2.6....but more importantly, we:

- began work on a 2-foot Purdue Hackers sign to display out the window
- made significant progress on Lightning Time 2.0â€”we haven't figured out HSL yet, but we landed on "arcs" for the name of the new day unit
- made significant progress on a new Purdue Hackers flag, though we haven't landed on a final design yet.

The energy was wonderful, we were shockingly productive, and much REFLECTING ðŸªž happened for sure.
