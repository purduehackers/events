🎷 Hack Night 5.11 was sponsored by Jazz (jazz.tools)! We ran a Session on building local-first apps, with demos of apps built with Jazz—including a live demo of Spyfall! Read the code: https://puhack.horse/spyfall

🎷 A friend of Purdue Hackers, Matthew Haubold, brought his saxophone to Hack Night and played smooth jazz music for all Hack Night attendees!

🎷The cooking group made SPAM burgers for folks while the Systems Circle talked about eBPF.

🎷 Tonight's 🏁Checkpoints featured people demoing many ongoing projects, including Qter (a Rubik's cube computer), keysmashd (speed up your computer by typing faster!), and a custom LaTeX renderer! We also demoed an implementation of the social deduction game Spyfall using Jazz, built at Hack Night!
