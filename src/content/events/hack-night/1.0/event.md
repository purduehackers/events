On November 4th, 2022, Hack Night officially exited beta and entered 1.0. In contrast to previous Hack Night events, which were unstructured, Hack Night 1.0 introduced a hackathon-like schedule. [See the full schedule!](https://doggo.ninja/mtXWls.png)

The biggest thing: the introduction of Sessions, or mini-workshops within Hack Night. During 1.0, we ran two sessions: [Database Art](https://ph-database-art.vercel.app/), where we pulled data from a database and turned it into generative art; and p5.js, where we explored perlin noise with p5.js.
