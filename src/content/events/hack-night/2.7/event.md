ðŸ’›âš¡âœ¨ðŸŒ™ The Hack Night to end all Hack Nights. We made a flag, started an awesome new sign project (to be continued next semester), ran an awesome session, made pancakes at 0~0~0, and stayed until 7:15am the next dayâ€”smashing the previous record of ~5:30am.

Hack Night is awesome. We can't wait for next semester.
