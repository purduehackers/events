We celebrated the flat earth at Hack Night 5.4!

🌎 A group of people baked bread!

🌎 The 10pm Session was a talk on a new Rubik's Cube computer, called "Qter"

🌎 People demoed incredible things at 🏁Checkpoints, like Qter, live room mapping on a Meta Quest, and a VSCode extension for competitive programming.
