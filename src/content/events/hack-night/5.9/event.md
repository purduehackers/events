🛠️ Autodesk sponsored Hack Night 5.9! We shared some of their CAD products with Hack Night attendees. We also made Hack Night's first ever metal badge, out of 16-gauage steel, using Autodesk Fusion

🛠️ We ran an open planning meeting for BURST ✷ at 10pm, and again after Checkpoints

🛠️ The Spoken Language Circle made progress on the spoken part (they've previously been working on the vine script), and the Systems Circle explored a multilevel feedback queue for process scheduling

🛠️ Folks shared awesome things at 🏁Checkpoints, including Apple Intelligence on an iPhone 12 😳
