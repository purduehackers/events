The latest evolution of Hack Night, and the best one yet. Hack Night 4.0 introduced:

- 🛂  **Passports:** Handmade, meticulously-crafted, NFC-enabled passports. Get stamped at Hack Night & gain access to exclusive things! 
- 🌟 **Reading Circles:** Like reading groups, reading circles make an agenda of topics to learn, then discuss & collaborate at Hack Night.
- 🌃 **Midnight demos:** After the countdown to 0, share what you've been working on—can be anything, including nontechnical projects & projects made outside of Hack Night!

We launched two Reading Circles: Linguistics and Conlanging, and Programming Languages. We typically run Sessions, or workshops within Hack Night, at 10pm, but at Hack Night 4.0 we took a break to run a passport-making ceremony instead, where 10 people made their own NFC-enabled passports! We also made the first passport stamp & everyone got their passports stamped.

Here's what happened at Hack Night 4.0:

- `d~5~5|5` **(8:00 PM):** Hacking begins
- `e~0~0` **(9:00 PM):** Reading Circle: Linguistics & Conlanging
- `e~a~a|a` **(10:00 PM):** Passport-making ceremony
- `f~5~5|5` **(11:00 PM):** Reading Circle: Programming Languages
- `0~0~0` **(12:00 AM):** Midnight demos

<br />

We also celebrated two birthdays with a giant cake!

And finally, Caesar Creek Software returned (their first appearance was at [Hack Night 2.0](https://blog.purduehackers.com/posts/hack-night-2.0)) to chat with students and hand out swag.

People worked on awesome projects, learned new things, hung out, ate pizza & cake. It was a great time.

Hack Night 4.0 ran until 6:30am.
