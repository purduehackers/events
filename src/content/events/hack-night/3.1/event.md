We celebrated one full rotation around the Sun!!! 🌞

Someone worked on a Purdue Hackers Hat 🧢, Trey made a [COLOR GAME!!!!!!!](https://color.navinate.com/), someone created a location changer for iOS, a group worked on a MC6809-based microcomputer, and another worked on an r/place-like [Purdue Mosaic](https://purdue-mosaic.onrender.com/).

Midnight snacks included popcorn, ramen, mac n' cheese, and pop tarts 😎
