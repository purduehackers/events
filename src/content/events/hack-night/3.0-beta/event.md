ðŸ’– The first Hack Night of the 2023-2024 school year, and it was one of our best events ever! We introduced Circles, a new way to facilitate projects & groups. This bumped our major version to 3.0â€”but since Circles is still an experiment, this event was 3.0 beta.

This event ran until 10:17am!!! Our longest event yet!!!!!
