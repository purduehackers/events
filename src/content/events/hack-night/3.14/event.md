Hack Night 3.14 introduced Reading Circles ðŸ“–: groups that gather at a certain time every week at Hack Night to learn something new, with some work assigned outside of Hack Night. We ran two Reading Circles: building a toy browser engine at 9pm, and programming languages at 11pm. Super exciting new chapter!!!

We also ran a sticker-making session at 10pm, ate pie at midnight, and people worked on awesome projects. Someone was working on building their own server, the sign circle finished assembling the sign, the first (version 0) passports were manufactured, and work began on the passport-based oauth service! Vibes were amazing.
