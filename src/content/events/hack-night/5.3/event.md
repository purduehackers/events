üåø Hack Night 5.3 was a special event. The badge was the best one we've ever made‚Äîit was 7 pieces of a hexagonal puzzle that, when assembled, revealed a message in a vine script that folks had to decode. The message led them to a website and a mysterious rotary phone placed in a corner of the Bechtel Center which contained another message. Those who made it all the way to the end received tickets which they redeemed for Insomnia cookies.

70 people joined us at Hack Night 5.3 and went on until 7:30. One group started a Rubik's cube computer, and someone else wrote a "brainfuck cpu" on their FPGA. People shared awesome things at Checkpoints as always.
