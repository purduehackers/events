25% CHECKPOINT REACHED ðŸš©

Thanks to ðŸ§¡Cloudflare for a third week of support. We had a blast discussing all the uses for R2 buckets (which our passports are built on).

- `d~5~5|5` **(8:00pm)**: Hacking begins
- `e~0~0` **(9:00pm)**: Circle: Spoken Language
- `e~a~a|a` **(10:00pm)**: Passport-making ceremony
- `f~5~5|5` **(11:00pm)**: Circle: Programming Languages
- `0~0~0` **(12:00am)**: Checkpoints

This was our first week running "Checkpoints" in place of ~midnight demos~, and it was a huge success. Checkpoints changed three things:

- They're called ðŸš©Checkpoints instead of ~Demos~
- You can only share something you worked on within the last week
- We brought a microphone and speaker so you don't have to fight for attention :)

The result was that folks shared lots of in-progress things that they otherwise would not have shared, and the speaker made it so that they didn't have to project nearly as much (and brought many more people to the front). Great event!
