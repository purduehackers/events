Giddy up and start horsing around at @Hack Night 6.10! 🐎 🫶

Here's what's happening:

- `d~5~5|5` **(8:00pm)**: Hacking begins
- `0~0~0` **(12:00am)**: Checkpoints 🤠

Hold your horses... working on your passion projects is the mane event here, not
homework or video games! Feel free to present a stable (or unstable) release at
checkpoints! 🐴
