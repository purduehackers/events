Sriram from Intel joined us, we ate Hot Ones hot sauces, some folks played laser tag in VR, the Conlanging Reading Circle started work on a new language, Ishan hid data inside images, and the PL Reading Circle kept going.

This was the last official Hack Night of Spring 2024, but it barely felt like it!
