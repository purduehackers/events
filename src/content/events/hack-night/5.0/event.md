🟩 Hack Night 5.0 was a magical upgrade. Here's what happened:

- `d~5~5|5` **(8:00pm)**: Hacking begins
- `d~a~a|a` **(8:30pm)**: Opening remarks
- `e~0~0` **(9:00pm)**: Session: Project brainstorming
- `e~a~a|a` **(10:00pm)**: Circle: Spoken language
- `f~5~5|5` **(11:00pm)**: Circle: Programming languages
- `0~0~0` **(12:00am)**: Demos
- `0~a~a|a` **(1:00am)**: Lightning talk: Nix

The theme was "brat" — more accurately, "hack night and it's the same but it's 5.0 so it's not" — just in time before the end of brat summer.

We ran demos for the first time (for real this time), kicking off weekly demos in preparation for The Show at the end of the semester.

🧡Cloudflare covered our pizza this week, which was all about how you can use Cloudflare Workers in your projects.

Some demos we want to highlight:

- Xander made his first PCB with the help of another Hack Night attendee
- Jadden & team made [ETea](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3085040/ETea/)
- Ray made a Tauri app that generates a short link to anything with a keyboard shortcut, using Cloudflare Workers

This is gonna be a good year 💛
