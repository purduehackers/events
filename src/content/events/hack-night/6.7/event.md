Six... seven?

You’re tired. We’re tired. But not tired enough to miss out on Hack Night 6.7! 🤷‍♂️

Here's what's happening:

- `d~5~5|5` **(8:00pm)**: Hacking begins
- `e~0~0` **(9:00pm)**: Session: Lightning talks
- `0~0~0` **(12:00am)**: Checkpoints

Lightning talks are short, 5-minute talks about literally anything. Just show up
and share something you're passionate about! If you'd like to be scheduled to
host a longer session in a future Hack Night, reach out!

See you TOMORROW (Friday 10/24) at 8pm on the 2nd Floor of the Bechtel Center! 💻🐇
