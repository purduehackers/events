A wonderful event! Someone CADded a case for the Lightning Time clock, we made progress on the clock, people drove a remote-controlled car around the floor, someone from the Computational Arts Circle ran a Session of an upcoming generative art workshop, someone displayed generative art on a hardware pixel board. Vibes were wonderful.

We didn't break a record for longest Hack Night, but we did break a record for longest time with more than 10 people: by 1:00am, around 15 people remained!
