🌵 Stranded in the desert at night, together, at Hack Night 5.2! There was plenty of 🍕food and water though 🌕

Thanks to 🧡Cloudflare for buying us pizza and giving us the opportunity to spread the word about Workers AI. A couple people built projects that used Workers AI tonight and started evangelizing it to others!

At midnight, folks demoed projects including a Teenage Engineering-like music player, an Arduino-powered GPS tracker, and a nuclear testing simulator for Meta Quest.

This event was a little bit lighter on events, which are expected to pick back up next week. Here's what happened:

- `d~5~5|5` **(8:00pm)**: Hacking begins
