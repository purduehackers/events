üåµ Stranded in the desert at night, together, at Hack Night 5.2! There was plenty of üçïfood and water though üåï

Thanks to üß°Cloudflare for buying us pizza and giving us the opportunity to spread the word about Workers AI. A couple people built projects that used Workers AI tonight and started evangelizing it to others!

At midnight, folks demoed projects including a Teenage Engineering-like music player, an Arduino-powered GPS tracker, and a nuclear testing simulator for Meta Quest.

This event was a little bit lighter on events, which are expected to pick back up next week. Here's what happened:

- `d~5~5|5` **(8:00pm)**: Hacking begins
- `e~0~0` **(9:00pm)**: ~Circle: Spoken Language~ Canceled
- `e~a~a|a` **(10:00pm)**: ~Session: TBD~ Canceled
- `f~5~5|5` **(11:00pm)**: Circle: Programming Languages
- `0~0~0` **(12:00am)**: Demos
