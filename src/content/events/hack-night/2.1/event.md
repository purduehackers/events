A purple curtain pulled back to reveal **Hack Night 2.1**, the purple eventâ€”and it was FANCY and ROYAL. Hackers feasted on wine, cheese, and crackers (where wine = grape and cranberry juice), made extravagant engineering decisions, and were given a badge of the highest possible honor.

One group played Kerbal Space Program. Another group made a website that pulls random quotes from a public API. [The new puhack.horse](https://github.com/purduehackers/puhack.horse) was shipped.
