Awesome week. Lots of cool stuff happened! Someone was working on an 8-bit computer, the sign folks were building firmware, and someone was building an AR game for the Meta Quest where you shoot each other with laser guns.

A passport-making ceremony happened, with 9 passports being made. It lasted a little longer than we wanted—1 hour and 45 minutes—but the resulting passports were excellent.

The Conlanging reading circle made more progress on their spiral script for the new language, and the Programming Languages reading circle is as strong as ever.

This week was eclipse themed 🌕☀️ because the 2024 solar eclipse had just happened that Monday!
