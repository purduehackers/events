üîî The bell tolled at Hack Night 5.6.

We ran another passport-making ceremony! 8 passports were made, and they were all super high-quality.

The baking group baked chocolate pies, and printed receipts entitling folks to one slice.

The Spoken Language Circle made lots of progress on the language, and was super well-attended üåø

The Systems Circle built a garbage collector in Zig üóëÔ∏è https://github.com/kartva/pholer

People demoed awesome things at üèÅCheckpoints, including an iOS app for posting to Discord via Shortcuts and a dot-grid notebook page design.

Incredible iteration, super energy-giving, lots going on!
