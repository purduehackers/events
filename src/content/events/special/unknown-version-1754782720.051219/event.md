BURST ✷ is a 4-hour pop-up gallery exhibition of creative technical projects, run by Purdue Hackers.

For 2 years, students in Purdue Hackers have been developing wacky, cutting-edge projects at Hack Night, our all-night hacker festival every Friday—but none have been seen by anyone outside Hack Night.

On Sunday, December 8th, we’re installing these creations in the Rueff Galleries on campus in a first-of-its-kind exhibition for the broader campus community. They’ll only be up for 4 hours, then never all in the same room again. Blink and you’ll miss it.
