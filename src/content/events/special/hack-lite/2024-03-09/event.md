Yes, there is a Hack Night before Spring Break! But it's not the kind of Hack Night you're used to...it's Hack Lite, a fake, knockoff version of Hack Night, with a badge made out of cardboard.

No official session or reading circles, unless those there want to make some impromptu ones happen.

If you're still on campus on Friday, come hang out. It'll be a lot of fun ðŸ“¦ plus you'll probably get to see the door opener working for the first time :O
