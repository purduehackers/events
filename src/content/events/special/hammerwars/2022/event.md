HammerWars was a competitive programming competition hosted by Purdue Hackers & sponsored by AWS & Deloitte. It was our last event of the 2021-2022 school year.

Over 4 hours, 110 people competed to complete CodeForces problems. Participants were split into three levels: beginner, intermediate, and advanced. After the competition ended, winners were awarded small prizes including a set of headphones & a drone.
