Are you a fan of laser tag? Do you love virtual reality games? Julian Triveri from Purdue Hackers has been working on an exciting new twistâ€”an augmented-reality laser tag game! Players wear mixed-reality headsets as they compete in a capture-the-flag style game, using virtual laser blasters.

The headsets offer an immersive experience, blending the real world with subtle virtual elements, while built-in safety indicators ensure players stay aware of their surroundings, preventing collisions with objects or each other.

If you're feeling excited, you should join us for a game! Grab a friend and form a team!
