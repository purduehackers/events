On August 30, 2022, Purdue Hackers ran our Fall 2022 Calloutâ€”our largest event ever. Way more people showed up than we expected, and than had ever showed up Purdue Hackers history: a room with a capacity of ~80 was packed, with people along the walls & spilling out into the hallway (don't tell SAO ðŸ˜³).

Over 15 minutes, we briefly shared our philosophy, before inviting people to come up to chat & ask questions.
