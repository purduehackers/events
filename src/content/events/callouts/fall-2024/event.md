üíõ‚ö°Ô∏è Making things is incredibly rewarding‚Äîbut it's hard to balance with academic & social obligations. Purdue Hackers is a community of kind & creative people who make things together: apps, websites, games, generative art, hardware, whatever.

There are three parts to Purdue Hackers:

<br/>

- **Community:** A friendly & vibrant community on [our Discord](https://puhack.horse/discord). We share all upcoming events in there.
- **Workshops:** Hour-long sessions where you learn something new & leave with a finished project.
- **Hack Night:** A hacker festival every Friday night, uninterrupted time for building projects. Come with your own projects, join a group, or just hang out!

<br/>

Purdue Hackers is for you, whether you've never written code before, or are highly technical. All majors are welcome!

We'd love to see you at our callout. To get an email reminder when it happens, sign up below.
