Our first event of the Spring 2022 semester. For an hour, Nikita walked 80(!!!) people through making a simple word classifier machine learning app using Python on Google Colab.

This workshop was going to be held in person, but had to be moved online due to a massive snowstormâ€”the largest in West Lafayette since 2007â€”which shut down the campus. Despite the last-minute change of plans, it was a huge success!
