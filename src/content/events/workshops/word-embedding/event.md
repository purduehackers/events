This is our first of three workshops in collaboration with [ML @ Purdue](https://ml-purdue.github.io)! Go check them out if you haven't already ðŸ’›

We learned about the basics of word embeddings, trained our own word embeddings, and used word embeddings for some cool applications (r/Purdue subreddit ðŸ˜‰)! 

We completely filled the room but if you missed out on the workshop, no worries! Check out these resources below:
