This was our SECOND of three workshops in collaboration with [ML @ Purdue](https://ml-purdue.github.io)! Go check them out if you haven't already ðŸ’›

We learned about the basics of sentence embeddings, queried documents like textbooks (haha CS 251 textbook), added context to an LLM, and built our own chatbot!
