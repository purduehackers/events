üìû‚ö°Ô∏èüéµüé® Rickrolling has been around nearly since the beginning of the internet‚Äîon Thursday, March 4th, 2022 we brought it out of the realm of the Internet and into the realm of phones.

Over an hour, 32 people used [Vonage](https://vonage.com), a communications API for developers to build phone & SMS apps, to build a small web app that calls a phone number & plays [Never Gonna Give You Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ). (Don't worry, we stayed ethical‚Äîthey called their own phones.) Along the way, they learned how web APIs, fundamental building blocks of the Internet, work, & how to use them to do creative & big things on the Web.

Many of the people who came to this workshop were total beginners‚Äîand everyone walked out with a finished project.
