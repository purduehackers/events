Our second event of the Spring 2022 semester, the GDB workshop is an annual Purdue Hackers tradition: over an hour, we teach an audience of mostly freshmen how to use the GDB debuggerâ€”an essential tool for writing C and getting through CS 240.

30 people showed up this year. Pankaj was an amazing presenter, & nearly everyone walked out knowing how to use GDB. As a side quest, they also learned how `malloc()` works :)
